# Message-Tree-Sorters
A storage place for a couple of my projects from COMS 228 at Iowa State

### HW2
This homework consisted of a "point" class, which gave items to be sorted. These items then needed to be sorted using Insertion, Merge, Selection, and Quick Sorts. Each of these sorting algorithms is built from scratch and is fairly efficient. The "points" are sorted by the first number and then the second. Running the program is as simple as running CompareSorters.java and inputting the number of points, seeded run or not, and how you would like to input points.

### HW4
Given an encoded message, the purpose of this project was to use binary trees to decode the hidden message or picture. The main point of this project was to test out all the data structures and algorithms learned throughout the semester to solve a problem. Running this program can be done by running MessageTree.java and entering one of the four files with the .arch ending to decode from.
